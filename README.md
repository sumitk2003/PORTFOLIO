Creating a portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is an excellent way to showcase your skills and projects while honing your web development expertise. Start by structuring your content with HTML, the backbone of your site. Use semantic elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer> to organize sections for your bio, projects, and contact information.
Enhance the visual appeal with CSS, designing a clean, responsive layout. Utilize grid or flexbox for alignment, and apply animations or transitions for interactive elements. Select color schemes and typography that reflect your personality and professionalism.
Add interactivity with JavaScript, such as form validation, dynamic project galleries, or smooth scrolling. Use frameworks or libraries like React or jQuery if desired, but keep it lightweight to ensure fast loading.
